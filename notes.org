Stuff left to do

- the multi-leader-key stuff mostly works, but there's still some weirdness
  around major-mode specific bindings. See the commented hack to prevent
  bindings from one mode bleading into buffers of a different mode.
- prefixes that don't have any assigned bindings in a given mode still show up
  in which key
- extra multi-leader-key into a plexmacs package
- pull the extra commands into a utility package
- see if the CIDER tweaks can (configurably) make it upstream  

Stuff still worth considering adding
- auto-highlight-symbol -> main thing I use this for in spacemacs is navigating
  with # and *
- org-mode -> kind of obvious
- magit -> I don't really use it much, but just improved commit message buffer
  bindings would be great, and if this is going to be a proper "distro" it
  should be in there.
- JS/python -> I don't want support for every language, but these two are so
  dominant they should be supported out of the box
- HTML/CSS -> the web, yo!
